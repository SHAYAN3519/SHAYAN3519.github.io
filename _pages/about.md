I am PhD student at UMass Amherst, specializing in the development of advanced 5G edge IoT devices. My PhD is under the supervision of [Dr. Taqi Raza](https://takiraza.github.io/) at [Khwarizmi Lab UMass](https://khwarizmilab.github.io/). I completed my Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering from [NUST](https://nust.edu.pk/), Pakistan.<br /> <br /> My expertise lies in the research and development of fundamental technologies that underpin Next Generation (NG) Mobile Networks. Our work is dedicated to crafting an architectural framework that adeptly addresses a wide array of application demands, including enhanced throughput, reduced latency, safety, and trust. With a focus on innovation, my role involves the design and implementation of novel network protocols that pave the way for efficient, safe, and secure mobile communications. This multi-faceted approach ensures that our contributions not only advance the technological landscape but also offer tangible solutions to the complex challenges faced by modern mobile networks.
